<p>John Allsopp goes on to write about the functions of website design and its seemingly<br>
simple way of connecting to code. He covers the basics of the use of color, text, imagery,<br>
layout and code and the philosophy a web designer must have in order to grasp their task.<br>
His philosophical references seem to be the most emphasized, however within his philosophy<br>
resides the equal importance of all subjects.</p>
<h2><a id="Competition_12"></a>Competition</h2>
<p>Understanding the internet as a medium and its competitors helps us put the web into<br>
perspective. The internets parent mediums, television, radio and print, can do things that<br>
one another cannot. However, these differences and restrictions of mediums are necessary<br>
because without them, other mediums could not exist. The internet can do things that the<br>
radio cannot, as the radio can do things print cannot and so on and so forth. John Allsopp<br>
goes on to mention that while this information may seem only like a history lesson, it<br>
does help us realize that not <em>everything</em> should be applied to the web as some things<br>
just arenâ€™t meant for it.</p>
<h2><a id="Control_23"></a>Control</h2>
<p>While a sense of control of web design is needed, in some cases we need to let go. Why?<br>
Because the designer need not shove his own restrictions down the audiences throat as they<br>
too need some sort of control to adjust the design to their own personal comfort. In this<br>
case, instead of setting rules like specifying the exact size the body text must be, we<br>
can set a percentage of which the body text is allowed to be controlled. So while we might<br>
have the body text be set at 10pt, we can allow the user to adjust this setting using<br>
percentages so that the body text can be adjusted to 12pt or 8pt depending on the users<br>
needs. This not only relieves stress from the designers shoulders, but also relieves the<br>
stress of those on the other end attempting to use your design. With this in mind, we can<br>
apply it to all different aspects of web design: color, text, imagery, and layout as all<br>
things fit underneath the same design philosohpy. As Bruce Lee would say,</p>
<blockquote>
<p>You must be shapeless, formless, like water.</p>
